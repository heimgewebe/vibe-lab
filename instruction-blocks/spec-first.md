Before generating any code:
1. Define the complete specification in a formal format (OpenAPI, Interface, Schema)
2. Include all constraints: input validation, error codes, edge cases
3. Review the specification for completeness
4. Only then proceed to implementation

Never skip the specification step — it is not overhead, it is the mechanism that activates structured constraint reasoning in the model.
